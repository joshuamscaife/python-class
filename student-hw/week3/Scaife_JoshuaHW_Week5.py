# An operator is one of the six functions used to compare values.
# A comparison operator compares two values and returns a boolean value, either true or false.
# The < operator checks to see if the left value is less than the right value.
# The == operator checks to see if the two values are exactly equal.
# The != operator checks to see if the two values are not equal.
# print (10 < 30) 
# # true
# print (30<20)
# # false
# print (20<=20)
# # true
# print (20!=29)
# # true
# The 'if' check allows a comparison operator to be used, and then as a result can runa another function such as 'print'.

   print("Ten is less than 20!")

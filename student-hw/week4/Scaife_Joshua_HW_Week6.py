# The 'else' statement is used as a backup for if the inital intented output does not occur.
# The 'elif' statement is used in between if and else statements to add extra possible oucomes if needed.
# The 'while' statement creates a looping comand.

# number = 22

# if number > 22:
#     print("A")
# elif number == 23:
#     print("B")
# elif number >= 22:

# C is printed.

# It will repeat 10 times.
# While repeats the 'if' command until certain criteria are met.

# for i in range(1, 5):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print('The for loop is over')
# The output is the numbers 1-4 and "the for loop is over".
# The 'for' keyword sets the variable i to a string in the range 1-5.
# Range is used to establish a set of numbers that the 'for' command can check.
# Break is used to stop a looping comand and exit.
# Continue is used to continue a looping comand after a function is completed.
